Subject: Soft limit handling bug fix

- Soft limit errors were stuck in a feed hold without notifying the
user why it was in a hold. When resumed, the soft limit error would
kick in. Issue should be fixed to behave as intended to automatically
hold and issue a soft limit alarm once the machine has come to a stop.

Subject: Bug fixes and more limit configurability

- Strange sizeof() bug in the most recent releases. Manifested as an
alarm upon a power up even when homing was disabled. Fixed by declaring
sizeof() with struct types, rather than variable names, even though
they were validated to give the same value.

- Spindle speed zero should disable the spindle. Now fixed.

- New configuration option for inverting certain limit pins. Handy for
mixed NO and NC switch machines. See config.h for details.

- Incremented version and pre-build firmware link.

Subject: Minor bug fixes.

- G38.x was not printing correctly in the $G g-code state reports. Now
fixed.

- Potential bug regarding volatile variables inside a struct. It has
never been a problem in v0.9, but ran into this during v1.0
development. Just to be safe, the fixes are applied here.

- Updated pre-built firmwares with these two bug fixes.

firmware supports the new EEPROM reset feature. Other than that, no
significant changes.
