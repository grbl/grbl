Subject: No variable spindle and spindle speed fix.

- When VARIABLE_SPINDLE output is disabled in config.h, the last commit
would keep the spindle enable pin disabled when spindle speed is not
defined (S0). This is now ignored and will enable with S0, as spindle
speed is ignored in this mode.

Subject: Soft limit handling bug fix

- Soft limit errors were stuck in a feed hold without notifying the
user why it was in a hold. When resumed, the soft limit error would
kick in. Issue should be fixed to behave as intended to automatically
hold and issue a soft limit alarm once the machine has come to a stop.

Subject: Bug fixes and more limit configurability

- Strange sizeof() bug in the most recent releases. Manifested as an
alarm upon a power up even when homing was disabled. Fixed by declaring
sizeof() with struct types, rather than variable names, even though
they were validated to give the same value.

- Spindle speed zero should disable the spindle. Now fixed.

- New configuration option for inverting certain limit pins. Handy for
mixed NO and NC switch machines. See config.h for details.

- Incremented version and pre-build firmware link.

Subject: Minor bug fixes.

- Planner was under-estimating maximum speeds through straight
junctions in certain cases. The calculations have been updated to be
more accurate.

- Type declaration fix in probe.c.

 - Commit log for v0.9j generated separately from v0.9iâ€™s.

- Incremented version and updated pre-built firmware link.

Subject: Minor bug fixes.

- G38.x was not printing correctly in the $G g-code state reports. Now
fixed.

- Potential bug regarding volatile variables inside a struct. It has
never been a problem in v0.9, but ran into this during v1.0
development. Just to be safe, the fixes are applied here.

- Updated pre-built firmwares with these two bug fixes.

firmware supports the new EEPROM reset feature. Other than that, no
significant changes.
