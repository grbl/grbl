Subject: New EEPROM restore functions.

- Tweaked the previous EEPROM restore implementation and added new
functionality.

- `$RST=$` restores the `$$` grbl settings back to firmware defaults,
which are set when compiled.

- `$RST=#` restores the `$#` parameters in EEPROM. At times it’s useful
to clear these and start over, rather than manually writing each entry.

-`$RST=*` wipe all of the data in EEPROM that Grbl uses and restores
them to defaults. This includes `$$` settings, `$#` parameters, `$N`
startup lines, and `$i` build info string.

NOTE: This doesn’t write zeros throughout the EEPROM. It only writes
where Grbl looks for data. For a complete wipe, please use the Arduino
IDE’s EEPROM clear example.

- Refactored the restore and wipe functions in settings.c to
accommodate the new commands.

- Created a limits_get_state() function to centralize it. It reports
state as a bit-wise booleans according to axis numbering.

- Updated the print uint8 functions. Generalized it to allow both base2
and base10 printouts, while allowing base2 prints with N_AXIS digits
for limit state status reports. Doing this saved about 100bytes of
flash as well.

- Applied CoreXY status reporting bug fix by @phd0. Thanks!

Subject: Critical M0/2/30 fix. Homing updates.

- Critical fix for M0 program pause. Due to its recent change, it would
cause Grbl to suspend but wouldn’t notify the user of why Grbl was not
doing anything. The state would show IDLE and a cycle start would
resume it. Grbl now enters a HOLD state to better indicate the state
change.

- Critical fix for M2 and M30 program end. As with M0, the state
previously would show IDLE while suspended. Grbl now does not suspend
upon program end and leaves job control to the GUI. Grbl simply reports
a `[Pgm End]` as a feedback message and resets certain g-code modes.

- M2/30 g-code reseting fix. Previously Grbl would soft-reset after an
M2/30, but this was not complaint to the (linuxcnc) g-code standard. It
simply resets [G1,G17,G90,G94,G40,G54,M5,M9,M48] and keeps all other
modes the same.

- M0/M2/M30 check-mode fix. It now does not suspend the machine during
check-mode.

- Minor bug fix related to commands similar to G90.1, but not G90.1,
not reporting an unsupported command.

- Homing cycle refactoring. To help reduce the chance of users
misunderstanding their limit switch wiring, Grbl only moves a short
distance for the locate cycles only. In addition, the homing cycle
pulls-off the limit switch by the pull-off distance to re-engage and
locate home. This should improve its accuracy.

- HOMING_FORCE_ORIGIN now sets the origin to the pull-off location,
rather than where the limit switch was triggered.

- Updated default junction deviation to 0.01mm. Recent tests showed
that this improves Grbl’s cornering behavior a bit.

- Added the ShapeOko3 defaults.

- Added new feedback message `[Pgm End]` for M2/30 notification.

- Limit pin reporting is now a $10 status report option. Requested by
OEMs to help simplify support troubleshooting.

Subject: New compile options and inverse time bug fix.

- Apparently inverse time motion were not working for quite some time.
Goes to show how many people actually use it. The calculation was bad
and is now fixed in this update. It should now work correctly.

- `;` comment type is now supported. This is standard on LinuxCNC and
common on 3d printers. It was previously not supported due to not
existing in the NIST standard, which is out-dated.

- New compile-option to ECHO the line received. This should help users
experiencing very weird problems and help diagnose if there is
something amiss in the communication to Grbl.

- New compile-option to use the spindle direction pin D13 as a spindle
enable pin with PWM spindle speed on D11. This feature has been
requested often from the laser cutter community. Since spindle
direction isn’t really of much use, it seemed like good good trade.
Note that M4 spindle enable counter-clock-wise support is removed for
obvious reasons, while M3 and M5 still work.

Subject: Cleaned-up limit pin reporting and comments.

- Cleaned up the limit pin state reporting option to display only the
state per axis, rather than the whole port. It’s organized by an XYZ
order, 0(low)-1(high), and generally looks like `Lim:001`.

- Separated the control pin state reporting from limit state reporting
as a new compile option. This stayed the same in terms of showing the
entire port in binary, since it’s not anticipated that this will be
used much, if at all.

- Updated some of the gcode source comments regarding supported g-codes.

Subject: G91.1 support. Fixed a config.h option.

- G91.1 support added. This g-code sets the arc IJK distance mode to
incremental, which is the default already. This simply  helps reduce
parsing errors with certain CAM programs that output this command.

- Max step rate checks weren’t being compiled in if the option was
enabled. Fixed now.

- Alarm codes were not displaying correctly when GUI reporting mode was
enabled. Due to unsigned int problem. Changed codes to positive values
since they aren’t shared with other codes.

Date: 2015-02-23
Author: Sonny Jeon
Subject: New configuration options.

- New configuration option at compile-time:
 - Force alarm upon power-up or hard reset. When homing is enabled,
this is already the default behavior. This simply forces this all of
the time.
 - GUI reporting mode. Removes most human-readable strings that GUIs
don’t need. This saves nearly 2KB in flash space that can be used for
other features.
 - Hard limit force state check: In the hard limit pin change ISR, Grbl
by default sets the hard limit alarm upon any pin change to guarantee
the alarm is set. If this option is set, it’ll check the state within
the ISR, but can’t guarantee the pin will be read correctly if the
switch is bouncing. This option makes hard limit behavior a little less
annoying if you have a good buffered switch circuit that removes
bouncing and electronic noise.

- Software debounce bug fix. It was reading the pin incorrectly for the
setting.

- Re-factored some of the ‘$’ settings code.


----------------

Subject: Improved homing limit search handling.

- Instead of a single overall max travel for a search distance for the
homing limit switches. The homing cycle now applies the max travel of
each axis to the search target. Generally makes more sense this way and
saved more than a 100bytes of flash too.

find the limit switch.

- Homing cycle bug fix when not finding the limit switch. It would just
idle before, but now will exit with an alarm.

- Licensing update. Corrected licensing according to lawyer
recommendations. Removed references to other Grbl versions.

----------------
Date: 2015-02-11
Author: Sonny Jeon
Subject: Overhauled state machine. New safety door feature.

- Overhauled the state machine and cleaned up its overall operation.
This involved creating a new ‘suspend’ state for what all external
commands, except real-time commands, are ignored. All hold type states
enter this suspend state.

- Removed ‘auto cycle start’ setting from Grbl. This was not used by
users in its intended way and is somewhat redundant, as GUI manage the
cycle start by streaming. It also muddled up how Grbl should interpret
how and when to execute a g-code block. Removing it made everything
much much simpler.

- Fixed a program pause bug when used with other buffer_sync commands.

- New safety door feature for OEMs. Immediately forces a feed hold and
then de-energizes the machine. Resuming is blocked until the door is
closed. When it is, it re-energizes the system and then resumes on the
normal toolpath.

- Safety door input pin is optional and uses the feed hold pin on A1.
Enabled by config.h define.

- Spindle and coolant re-energizing upon a safety door resume has a
programmable delay time to allow for complete spin up to rpm and
turning on the coolant before resuming motion.

- Safety door-style feed holds can be used instead of regular feed hold
(doesn’t de-energize the machine) with a ‘@‘ character. If the safety
door input pin is not enabled, the system can be resumed at any time.

- Added an ‘examples’ directory with an upload .INO sketch to further
simplify compiling and uploading Grbl via the Arduino IDE.

- Updated the Makefile with regard to the source code no longer being

operate in the same way as it did before.

Subject: Bug fix for certain motions. Re-org of includes.

- Critical bug fix for diagonal motions that continue on the same
direction or return in the exact opposite direction. This issue could
cause Grbl to crash intermittently due to a numerical round-off error.
Grbl versions prior to v0.9g shouldn’t have this issue.

- Reorganized all of the includes used by Grbl. Centralized it into a
single “grbl.h” include. This will help simplify the compiling and
uploading process through the Arduino IDE.

- Added an example .INO file for users to simply open and run when
compiling and uploading through the IDE. More to come later.

Subject: Limit/control pin state reporting option

- As a setup feature, users can compile-in input pin status reporting.
Doesn’t do anything special, just prints the binary for the port. 0’s
and 1’s indicate low and high signals on the pins. It’s a bit cryptic
right now, but it’s just a start.

- Added a max step rate check when writing step/mm and max rate
settings. Should help avoid people misdiagnosing problems associated
with going over the 30kHz step rate limit. Right now not enabled. Takes
up over 100k of flash. Need that room for other things right now.

Subject: Fully configurable pins for NO or NC switches.

- All pins, which include limits, control command, and probe pins, can
now all be configured to trigger as active-low or active-high and
whether the pin has its internal pull-up resistor enabled. This should
allow for just about all types of NO and NC switch configurations.

- The probe pin invert setting hasn’t been added to the Grbl settings,
like the others, and will have to wait until v1.0. But for now, it’s
available as a compile-time option in config.h.

- Fixed a variable spindle bug.

Author: Sonny Jeon
Subject: Lot of refactoring for the future. CoreXY support.

- Rudimentary CoreXY kinematics support. Didn’t test, but homing and
feed holds should work. See config.h. Please report successes and
issues as we find bugs.

- G40 (disable cutter comp) is now “supported”. Meaning that Grbl will
no longer issue an error when typically sent in g-code program header.

- Refactored coolant and spindle state setting into separate functions
for future features.

- Configuration option for fixing homing behavior when there are two
limit switches on the same axis sharing an input pin.

- Created a new “grbl.h” that will eventually be used as the main
include file for Grbl. Also will help simply uploading through the
Arduino IDE

- Separated out the alarms execution flags from the realtime (used be
called runtime) execution flag variable. Now reports exactly what
caused the alarm. Expandable for new alarms later on.

- Refactored the homing cycle to support CoreXY.

- Applied @EliteEng updates to Mega2560 support. Some pins were
reconfigured.

- Created a central step to position and vice versa function. Needed
for non-traditional cartesian machines. Should make it easier later.

- Removed the new CPU map for the Uno. No longer going to used. There
will be only one configuration to keep things uniform.

Subject: Updated variable spindle and new probing. Minor bug fixes.

- Minor bug fix for variable spindle PWM output. Values smaller than
the minimum RPM for the spindle would overflow the PWM value. Thanks
Rob!

- Created an optional minimum spindle PWM low-mark value as a
compile-time option. This is for special circumstances when the PWM has
to be at a certain level to be read by the spindle controller.

- Refactored the new probing commands (G38.3, G38.4, G38.5) code to
work better with the rest of Grbl’s systems.

- Refactored mc_probe() and mc_arc() to accept the mode of the command,
i.e. clockwise vs counter, toward vs away, etc. This is to make these
functions independent of gcode state variables.

- Removed the pull off motion in the probing cycle. This is not an
official operation and was added for user simplicity, but wrongly did
so. So bye bye.

- Created a configure probe invert mask function to handle the
different probe pin setting and probing cycle modes with a single mask.

 - Minor bug fix with reporting motion modes via $G. G38.2 wasn’t
showing up. It now does, along with the other new probing commands.

- Refactored some of the new pin configurations for the future of Grbl.
