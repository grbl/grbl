Stream g-code to grbl controller

This script differs from the simple_stream.py script by 
tracking the number of characters in grbl's serial read
buffer. This allows grbl to fetch the next line directly
from the serial buffer and does not have to wait for a 
response from the computer. This effectively adds another
buffer layer to prevent buffer starvation.

CHANGELOG:
- 20140714: Updated baud rate to 115200. Added a settings
  write mode via simple streaming method. MIT-licensed.

TODO: 
- Add runtime command capabilities
