Allocation of AVR peripherals in Grbl
=====================================

See config.h for pin allocation.

The UART is handled by 'serial' and used primarily for streaming gcode

16 bit Timer 1 and the TIMER1_COMPA interrupt is used by the 'stepper' module to handle step events

8 bit Timer 0 and the TIMER0_OVF interrupt is used by the 'stepper' module to reset the step pins 
after a step event

Timer2 is used for PWM control of Arduino Pin 11 associated with Spindle Speed commands
