Allocation of AVR peripherals in Grbl
=====================================

See config.h for pin allocation.

The UART is handled by 'serial' and used primarily for streaming gcode

16 bit Timer 1 and the TIMER1_COMPA interrupt is used by the 'stepper' module to handle step events

8 bit Timer 2 and the TIMER2_OVF interrupt is used by the 'stepper' module to reset the step pins 
after a step event
