Grbl is a no-compromise, high performance, low cost alternative to parallel-port-based motion control for CNC milling. It will run on a vanilla Arduino (Duemillanove/Uno) as long as it sports an Atmega 328. 

The controller is written in highly optimized C utilizing every clever feature of the AVR-chips to achieve precise timing and asynchronous operation. It is able to maintain up to 30kHz of stable, jitter free control pulses.

It accepts standards-compliant g-code and has been tested with the output of several CAM tools with no problems. Arcs, circles and helical motion are fully supported, as well as, all other primary g-code commands. Macro functions, variables, and most canned cycles are not supported, but we think GUIs can do a much better job at translating them into straight g-code anyhow.

Grbl includes full acceleration management with look ahead. That means the controller will look up to 18 motions into the future and plan its velocities ahead to deliver smooth acceleration and jerk-free cornering.

_**Master Branch:**_
* [Grbl v0.9i Atmega328p 16mhz 115200baud with generic defaults](http://bit.ly/1EiviDk) _(2015-06-25)_
* [Grbl v0.9i Atmega328p 16mhz 115200baud with ShapeOko2 defaults](http://bit.ly/1NYIfKl) _(2015-06-25)_
  - **IMPORTANT INFO WHEN UPGRADING TO GRBL v0.9i:** 
  - Baudrate is now **115200** (Up from 9600). 
  - Homing cycle updated. Located based on switch trigger, rather than release point.
  - Variable spindle is now enabled by default. Z-limit(D12) and spindle enable(D11) have switched to access the hardware PWM on D11. Homing will not work if you do not re-wire your Z-limit switch to D12.

##Update Summary for v0.9i
  - **IMPORTANT:**
    - **Z-limit(D12) and spindle enable(D11) pins have switched to support variable spindle!**
    - **Homing cycle updated. Locates based on trigger point, rather than release point.**
    - **System tweaks: $14 cycle auto-start has been removed. No more QUEUE state.**
  - **New G-Codes:** Additional probing cycle commands G38.3, G38.4, G38.5 now supported. G40 cutter radius compensation cancel. G91.1 arc IJK distance mode incremental. G61 exact path mode.
  - **CoreXY Support:** Grbl now supports CoreXY kinematics on an introductory-level. Most functions have been verified to work, but there may be bugs here or there. Please report any problems you find!
  - **Safety Door Support:** Safety door switches are now supported. Grbl will force a feed hold, shutdown the spindle and coolant, and wait until the door switch has closed and the user has issued a resume. Upon resuming, the spindle and coolant will re-energize after a configurable delay and continue. Useful for OEMs that require this feature.
  - **Full Limit and Control Pin Configurability:** Limits and control pins operation can now be interpreted by Grbl however you'd like, with the internal pull-up resistors enabled or disabled, or reading a high or low as a trigger. This should cover all wiring and NO or NC switch scenarios.
  - **Additional Compile-Time Feature Options:** Control pin state reporting, force power-up alarm state, GUI reporting mode, and more.
