  /* Vector rotation by transformation matrix: r is the original vector, r_T is the rotated vector,
     and phi is the angle of rotation. Based on the solution approach by Jens Geisler.
         r_T = [cos(phi) -sin(phi);
                sin(phi)  cos(phi] * r ;
     
     For arc generation, the center of the circle is the axis of rotation and the radius vector is 
     defined from the circle center to the initial position. Each line segment is formed by successive
     vector rotations. This requires only two cos() and sin() computations to form the rotation
     matrix for the duration of the entire arc. Error may accumulate from numerical round-off, since
     all double numbers are single precision on the Arduino. (True double precision will not have
     round off issues for CNC applications.) Single precision error can accumulate to be greater than
     tool precision in some cases. Therefore, arc path correction is implemented. 

     Small angle approximation may be used to reduce computation overhead further. This approximation
     holds for everything, but very small circles and large mm_per_arc_segment values. In other words,
     theta_per_segment would need to be greater than 0.1 rad and N_ARC_CORRECTION would need to be large
     to cause an appreciable drift error. N_ARC_CORRECTION~=25 is more than small enough to correct for 
     numerical drift error. N_ARC_CORRECTION may be on the order a hundred(s) before error becomes an
     issue for CNC machines with the single precision Arduino calculations.
     
     This approximation also allows mc_arc to immediately insert a line segment into the planner 
     without the initial overhead of computing cos() or sin(). By the time the arc needs to be applied
     a correction, the planner should have caught up to the lag caused by the initial mc_arc overhead. 
     This is important when there are successive arc motions.
