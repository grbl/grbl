  The planner block buffer is planned assuming constant acceleration velocity profiles and are

  the block entry speeds for an optimal velocity plan, but does not compute the block internal
  velocity profiles. These velocity profiles are computed ad-hoc as they are executed by the 
  stepper algorithm and consists of only 7 possible types of profiles: cruise-only, cruise-
  deceleration, acceleration-cruise, acceleration-only, deceleration-only, full-trapezoid, and 
  triangle(no cruise).

/* "The Stepper Driver Interrupt" - This timer interrupt is the workhorse of Grbl. Grbl employs
   the venerable Bresenham line algorithm to manage and exactly synchronize multi-axis moves.
   Unlike the popular DDA algorithm, the Bresenham algorithm is not susceptible to numerical
   round-off errors and only requires fast integer counters, meaning low computational overhead
   and maximizing the Arduino's capabilities. However, the downside of the Bresenham algorithm
   is, for certain multi-axis motions, the non-dominant axes may suffer from un-smooth step 
   pulse trains, or aliasing, which can lead to strange audible noises or shaking. This is 
   particularly noticeable or may cause motion issues at low step frequencies (0-5kHz), but 
   is usually not a physical problem at higher frequencies, although audible.
     To improve Bresenham multi-axis performance, Grbl uses what we call an Adaptive Multi-Axis
   Step Smoothing (AMASS) algorithm, which does what the name implies. At lower step frequencies,
   AMASS artificially increases the Bresenham resolution without effecting the algorithm's 
   innate exactness. AMASS adapts its resolution levels automatically depending on the step
   frequency to be executed, meaning that for even lower step frequencies the step smoothing 
   level increases. Algorithmically, AMASS is acheived by a simple bit-shifting of the Bresenham
   step count for each AMASS level. For example, for a Level 1 step smoothing, we bit shift 
   the Bresenham step event count, effectively multiplying it by 2, while the axis step counts 
   remain the same, and then double the stepper ISR frequency. In effect, we are allowing the
   non-dominant Bresenham axes step in the intermediate ISR tick, while the dominant axis is 
   stepping every two ISR ticks, rather than every ISR tick in the traditional sense. At AMASS
   Level 2, we simply bit-shift again, so the non-dominant Bresenham axes can step within any 
   of the four ISR ticks, the dominant axis steps every four ISR ticks, and quadruple the 
   stepper ISR frequency. And so on. This, in effect, virtually eliminates multi-axis aliasing 
   issues with the Bresenham algorithm and does not significantly alter Grbl's performance, but 
   in fact, more efficiently utilizes unused CPU cycles overall throughout all configurations.
     AMASS retains the Bresenham algorithm exactness by requiring that it always executes a full
   Bresenham step, regardless of AMASS Level. Meaning that for an AMASS Level 2, all four 
   intermediate steps must be completed such that baseline Bresenham (Level 0) count is always 
   retained. Similarly, AMASS Level 3 means all eight intermediate steps must be executed. 
   Although the AMASS Levels are in reality arbitrary, where the baseline Bresenham counts can
   be multiplied by any integer value, multiplication by powers of two are simply used to ease 
   CPU overhead with bitshift integer operations. 
     This interrupt is simple and dumb by design. All the computational heavy-lifting, as in
   determining accelerations, is performed elsewhere. This interrupt pops pre-computed segments,
   defined as constant velocity over n number of steps, from the step segment buffer and then 
   executes them by pulsing the stepper pins appropriately via the Bresenham algorithm. This 
   ISR is supported by The Stepper Port Reset Interrupt which it uses to reset the stepper port
   after each pulse. The bresenham line tracer algorithm controls all stepper outputs
   simultaneously with these two interrupts.
   
   NOTE: This interrupt must be as efficient as possible and complete before the next ISR tick, 
   which for Grbl must be less than 33.3usec (@30kHz ISR rate). Oscilloscope measured time in 
   ISR is 5usec typical and 25usec maximum, well below requirement.
   NOTE: This ISR expects at least one step to be executed per segment.

/* Prepares step segment buffer. Continuously called from main program. 

   The segment buffer is an intermediary buffer interface between the execution of steps
   by the stepper algorithm and the velocity profiles generated by the planner. The stepper
   algorithm only executes steps within the segment buffer and is filled by the main program
   when steps are "checked-out" from the first block in the planner buffer. This keeps the
   step execution and planning optimization processes atomic and protected from each other.
   The number of steps "checked-out" from the planner buffer and the number of segments in
   the segment buffer is sized and computed such that no operation in the main program takes
   longer than the time it takes the stepper algorithm to empty it before refilling it. 
   Currently, the segment buffer conservatively holds roughly up to 40-50 msec of steps.
   NOTE: Computation units are in steps, millimeters, and minutes.
