h1. LCGCi - An embedded g-code interpreter and motion-controller for AVR microcontrollers, based on GRBL 0.7b developed for CNC lasers (specifically for www.buildlog.net 2.X lasers)
    
LCGCi (Laser Controller, G-Code interpreter) is on open source code meant to run on one (or two) AVR microcontroller(s) The software is based on the GRBL software v0.7b.  The basic g-code interpreter and stepper controller will are used as the basic workings of the LCGCi.  However, several features will be added that make the code specific for laser cutters and will be extended to work as a headless controller (with two AVR’s running together).  The slave controller will host the modified GRBL software and its sole purpose is to interpret streamed g-code from the master controller.  The master will read g-code from an SD card and pass it via serial to the slave.  The master will also monitor variables and pass data through USB to a computer.  During a any run, the control comes from the master and will in no way depend on the computer.  The computer will be used to set up files and display information.
