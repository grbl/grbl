This is an autotools package for building the grbl firmware and 
uploading it to an Arduino.  

By default, the configure options are set up to compile the firmware for
a plain vanilla Arduino Uno and upload the firmware on /dev/ttyACM0. 

=== PREREQUISITES ===
To compile the grbl firmware, you must have the AVR gcc build environment
installed.  On ubunutu or any Debian-based system, you can do this by 
running the command:

   sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc avrdude


=== USAGE ===
To install grbl onto an Arduino Uno, just plug in the Uno to your PC
and run the following commands:

   ./configure 
   make
   make install

As long as your Uno picked up /dev/ttyACM0 for the serial port, the above
commands should work w/ no problems.  To confirm it's working, install
minicom, configure it to connect to /dev/ttyACM0 at 9600 bps and 
start typing commands.


=== OPTIONS ===
The configure script has the following environment variables that you
can customize.  Below is a list of them along with their defaults
in brackets:

  MMCU        "AVR processor type (atmega328p)"
  MHZ         "AVR processor speed in MHz. (16)"
  AVRDUDE_PARTNO
              "avrdude part number id. (m328p)"
  AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER
              "avrdude programmer id. (arduino)"
  AVRDUDE_SERIAL_PORT
              "avrdude serial port. (/dev/ttyACM0)"
  AVRDUDEFLAGS
              "Extra avrdude flags. (-D)"

To use the options, just specify them on the command line when you
run configure.  For example, to install grbl onto an Arduino Mega 
using an AVR ISP2 programmer and set custom avrdude fuses, you would 
run the following commands:

   ./configure MMCU=atmega2560 MHZ=16 \
      AVRDUDE_PARTNO=m2560 \
      AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER=avrisp2 \
      AVRDUDEFLAGS="-U hfuse:w:0xd2:m -U lfuse:w:0xff:m"
   make
   make install

I've never actually used one of these programmer things but in theory 
it should work.  This package has been tested using both Ubuntu 10.04 
and 11.10 on a plain old arduino Uno and confirmed to work.
