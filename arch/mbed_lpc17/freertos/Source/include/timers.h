 * Type by which software timers are referenced.  For example, a call to
 * xTimerCreate() returns an xTimerHandle variable that can then be used to
 * reference the subject timer in calls to other software timer API functions
 * (for example, xTimerStart(), xTimerReset(), etc.).
 */
typedef void * xTimerHandle;

/* Define the prototype to which timer callback functions must conform. */
typedef void (*tmrTIMER_CALLBACK)( xTimerHandle xTimer );

/**
 * xTimerHandle xTimerCreate( 	const signed char *pcTimerName,
 * 								portTickType xTimerPeriod,
 * 								unsigned portBASE_TYPE uxAutoReload,
 * 								void * pvTimerID,
 * 								tmrTIMER_CALLBACK pxCallbackFunction );
 *
 * Creates a new software timer instance.  This allocates the storage required
 * by the new timer, initialises the new timers internal state, and returns a
 * handle by which the new timer can be referenced.
 *
 * Timers are created in the dormant state.  The xTimerStart(), xTimerReset(),
 * xTimerStartFromISR(), xTimerResetFromISR(), xTimerChangePeriod() and
 * xTimerChangePeriodFromISR() API functions can all be used to transition a timer into the
 * active state.
 *
 * @param pcTimerName A text name that is assigned to the timer.  This is done
 * purely to assist debugging.  The kernel itself only ever references a timer by
 * its handle, and never by its name.
 *
 * @param xTimerPeriod The timer period.  The time is defined in tick periods so
 * the constant portTICK_RATE_MS can be used to convert a time that has been
 * specified in milliseconds.  For example, if the timer must expire after 100
 * ticks, then xTimerPeriod should be set to 100.  Alternatively, if the timer
 * must expire after 500ms, then xPeriod can be set to ( 500 / portTICK_RATE_MS )
 * provided configTICK_RATE_HZ is less than or equal to 1000.
 *
 * @param uxAutoReload If uxAutoReload is set to pdTRUE then the timer will
 * expire repeatedly with a frequency set by the xTimerPeriod parameter.  If
 * uxAutoReload is set to pdFALSE then the timer will be a one-shot timer and
 * enter the dormant state after it expires.
 *
 * @param pvTimerID An identifier that is assigned to the timer being created.
 * Typically this would be used in the timer callback function to identify which
 * timer expired when the same callback function is assigned to more than one
 * timer.
 *
 * @param pxCallbackFunction The function to call when the timer expires.
 * Callback functions must have the prototype defined by tmrTIMER_CALLBACK,
 * which is	"void vCallbackFunction( xTimerHandle xTimer );".
 *
 * @return If the timer is successfully create then a handle to the newly
 * created timer is returned.  If the timer cannot be created (because either
 * there is insufficient FreeRTOS heap remaining to allocate the timer
 * structures, or the timer period was set to 0) then 0 is returned.
 *

 *
 *

 * // An array to hold handles to the created timers.
 * xTimerHandle xTimers[ NUM_TIMERS ];
 *
 * // An array to hold a count of the number of times each timer expires.
 * long lExpireCounters[ NUM_TIMERS ] = { 0 };
 *
 * // Define a callback function that will be used by multiple timer instances.
 * // The callback function does nothing but count the number of times the
 * // associated timer expires, and stop the timer once the timer has expired
 * // 10 times.

 *
