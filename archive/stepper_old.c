   The trapezoid is the shape the speed curve over time. It starts at block->initial_rate, accelerates by block->rate_delta
   until reaching cruising speed block->nominal_rate, and/or until step_events_remaining reaches block->decelerate_after
   after which it decelerates until the block is completed. The driver uses constant acceleration, which is applied as
   +/- block->rate_delta velocity increments by the midpoint rule at each ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND.

/* "The Stepper Driver Interrupt" - This timer interrupt is the workhorse of Grbl. It is based
   on an inverse time stepper algorithm, where a timer ticks at a constant frequency and uses 
   time-distance counters to track when its the approximate time for a step event. For reference,
   a similar inverse-time algorithm by Pramod Ranade is susceptible to numerical round-off,
   meaning that some axes steps may not execute correctly for a given multi-axis motion.
     Grbl's algorithm differs by using a single inverse time-distance counter to manage a
   Bresenham line algorithm for multi-axis step events, which ensures the number of steps for
   each axis are executed exactly. In other words, Grbl uses a Bresenham within a Bresenham 
   algorithm, where one tracks time for step events and the other steps for multi-axis moves.
   Grbl specifically uses the Bresenham algorithm due to its innate mathematical exactness and
   low computational overhead, requiring simple integer +,- counters only.
     This interrupt pops blocks from the step segment buffer and executes them by pulsing the 
   stepper pins appropriately. It is supported by The Stepper Port Reset Interrupt which it uses 
   to reset the stepper port after each pulse. The bresenham line tracer algorithm controls all 
   three stepper outputs simultaneously with these two interrupts.
*/
/* TODO: 
   - Measure time in ISR. Typical and worst-case. Should be virtually identical to last algorithm.
     There are no major changes to the base operations of this ISR with the new segment buffer.
   - Write how the acceleration counters work and why they are set at half via mid-point rule.
   - Determine if placing the position counters elsewhere (or change them to 8-bit variables that
     are added to the system position counters at the end of a segment) frees up cycles.
   - Write a blurb about how the acceleration should be handled within the ISR. All of the 
     time/step/ramp counters accurately keep track of the remainders and phasing of the variables
     with time. This means we do not have to compute them via expensive floating point beforehand.
   - Need to do an analysis to determine if these counters are really that much cheaper. At least
     find out when it isn't anymore. Particularly when the ISR is at a very high frequency.

/* Prepares step segment buffer. Continuously called from main program. 

   The segment buffer is an intermediary buffer interface between the execution of steps
   by the stepper algorithm and the velocity profiles generated by the planner. The stepper
   algorithm only executes steps within the segment buffer and is filled by the main program
   when steps are "checked-out" from the first block in the planner buffer. This keeps the
   step execution and planning optimization processes atomic and protected from each other.
   The number of steps "checked-out" from the planner buffer and the number of segments in
   the segment buffer is sized and computed such that no operation in the main program takes
   longer than the time it takes the stepper algorithm to empty it before refilling it. 
   Currently, the segment buffer conservatively holds roughly up to 40-60 msec of steps. 

   NOTE: The segment buffer executes a set number of steps over an approximate time period.
   If we try to execute over a set time period, it is difficult to guarantee or predict how
   many steps will execute over it, especially when the step pulse phasing between the
   neighboring segments are kept consistent. Meaning that, if the last segment step pulses
   right before its end, the next segment must delay its first pulse so that the step pulses
   are consistently spaced apart over time to keep the step pulse train nice and smooth. 
   Keeping track of phasing and ensuring that the exact number of steps are executed as
   defined by the planner block, the related computational overhead gets quickly and
   prohibitively expensive, especially in real-time.
     Since the stepper algorithm automatically takes care of the step pulse phasing with
   its ramp and inverse time counters, we don't have to explicitly and expensively track the
   exact number of steps, time, or phasing of steps. All we need to do is approximate
   the number of steps in each segment such that the segment buffer has enough execution time
   for the main program to do what it needs to do and refill it when it has time. In other
   words, we just need to compute a cheap approximation of the current velocity and the 
   number of steps over it.

/* 
   TODO: Figure out how to enforce a deceleration when a feedrate override is reduced. 
     The problem is that when an override is reduced, the planner may not plan back to 
     the current rate. Meaning that the velocity profiles for certain conditions no longer
     are trapezoidal or triangular. For example, if the current block is cruising at a
     nominal rate and the feedrate override is reduced, the new nominal rate will now be
     lower. The velocity profile must first decelerate to the new nominal rate and then 
     follow on the new plan. So the remaining velocity profile will have a decelerate, 
     cruise, and another decelerate.
        Another issue is whether or not a feedrate override reduction causes a deceleration
     that acts over several planner blocks. For example, say that the plan is already 
     heavily decelerating throughout it, reducing the feedrate will not do much to it. So,
     how do we determine when to resume the new plan? How many blocks do we have to wait 
     until the new plan intersects with the deceleration curve? One plus though, the 
     deceleration will never be more than the number of blocks in the entire planner buffer,
     but it theoretically can be equal to it when all planner blocks are decelerating already.
