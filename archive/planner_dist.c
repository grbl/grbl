  Recalculates the motion plan according to the following basic guidelines:
  
    1. Go over every feasible block sequentially in reverse order and calculate the junction speeds
        (i.e. current->entry_speed) such that:
      a. No junction speed exceeds the pre-computed maximum junction speed limit or nominal speeds of 
         neighboring blocks.
      b. A block entry speed cannot exceed one reverse-computed from its exit speed (next->entry_speed)
         with a maximum allowable deceleration over the block travel distance.
      c. The last (or newest appended) block is planned from a complete stop (an exit speed of zero).
    2. Go over every block in chronological (forward) order and dial down junction speed values if 
      a. The exit speed exceeds the one forward-computed from its entry speed with the maximum allowable
         acceleration over the block travel distance.
  
  When these stages are complete, the planner will have maximized the velocity profiles throughout the all
  of the planner blocks, where every block is operating at its maximum allowable acceleration limits. In 
  other words, for all of the blocks in the planner, the plan is optimal and no further speed improvements
  are possible. If a new block is added to the buffer, the plan is recomputed according to the said 
  guidelines for a new optimal plan.
  
  To increase computational efficiency of these guidelines, a set of planner block pointers have been
  created to indicate stop-compute points for when the planner guidelines cannot logically make any further
  changes or improvements to the plan when in normal operation and new blocks are streamed and added to the
  planner buffer. For example, if a subset of sequential blocks in the planner have been planned and are 
  bracketed by junction velocities at their maximums (or by the first planner block as well), no new block
  added to the planner buffer will alter the velocity profiles within them. So we no longer have to compute
  them. Or, if a set of sequential blocks from the first block in the planner (or a optimal stop-compute
  point) are all accelerating, they are all optimal and can not be altered by a new block added to the
  planner buffer, as this will only further increase the plan speed to chronological blocks until a maximum
  junction velocity is reached. However, if the operational conditions of the plan changes from infrequently
  used feed holds or feedrate overrides, the stop-compute pointers will be reset and the entire plan is  
  recomputed as stated in the general guidelines.
  
  Planner buffer index mapping:
  - block_buffer_tail: Points to the beginning of the planner buffer. First to be executed or being executed. 
  - block_buffer_head: Points to the buffer block after the last block in the buffer. Used to indicate whether
      the buffer is full or empty. As described for standard ring buffers, this block is always empty.
  - next_buffer_head: Points to next planner buffer block after the buffer head block. When equal to the 
      buffer tail, this indicates the buffer is full.
  - block_buffer_safe: Points to the first sequential planner block for which it is safe to recompute, which
      is defined to be where the stepper's step segment buffer ends. This may or may not be the buffer tail, 
      since the step segment buffer queues steps which may have not finished executing and could span a few
      blocks, if the block moves are very short.   
  - block_buffer_planned: Points to the first buffer block after the last optimally planned block for normal
      streaming operating conditions. Use for planning optimizations by avoiding recomputing parts of the 
      planner buffer that don't change with the addition of a new block, as describe above.
  
  NOTE: All planner computations are performed in floating point to minimize numerical round-off errors.
  When a planner block is executed, the floating point values are converted to fast integers by the stepper
  algorithm segment buffer. See the stepper module for details. 
  
  NOTE: Since the planner only computes on what's in the planner buffer, some motions with lots of short 
  line segments, like G2/3 arcs or complex curves, may seem to move slow. This is because there simply isn't
  enough combined distance traveled in the entire buffer to accelerate up to the nominal speed and then 
  decelerate to a complete stop at the end of the buffer, as stated by the guidelines. If this happens and
  becomes an annoyance, there are a few simple solutions: (1) Maximize the machine acceleration. The planner
  will be able to compute higher velocity profiles within the same combined distance. (2) Maximize line 
  segment(s) distance per block to a desired tolerance. The more combined distance the planner has to use,
  the faster it can go. (3) Maximize the planner buffer size. This also will increase the combined distance
  for the planner to compute over. It also increases the number of computations the planner has to perform
  to compute an optimal plan, so select carefully. The Arduino 328p memory is already maxed out, but future
  ARM versions should have enough memory and speed for look-ahead blocks numbering up to a hundred or more.

       NOTE: If the junction deviation value is finite, Grbl executes the motions in an exact path 
       mode (G61). If the junction deviation value is zero, Grbl will execute the motion in an exact
       stop mode (G61.1) manner. In the future, if continuous mode (G64) is desired, the math here
       is exactly the same. Instead of motioning all the way to junction point, the machine will
       just follow the arc circle defined here. The Arduino doesn't have the CPU cycles to perform
       a continuous mode path, but ARM-based microcontrollers most certainly do. 
       
       NOTE: The max junction speed is a fixed value, since machine acceleration limits cannot be
       changed dynamically during operation nor can the line move geometry. This must be kept in
       memory in the event of a feedrate override changing the nominal speeds of blocks, which can 
       change the overall maximum entry speed conditions of all blocks.

  Calculates the type of velocity profile for a given planner block and provides the deceleration
  distance for the stepper algorithm to use to accurately trace the profile exactly. The planner
  computes the entry and exit speeds of each block, but does not bother to determine the details of
  the velocity profiles within them, as they aren't needed for computing an optimal plan. When the
  stepper algorithm begins to execute a block, the block velocity profiles are computed ad hoc. 
  
  Each block velocity profiles can be described as either a trapezoidal or a triangular shape. The
  trapezoid occurs when the block reaches the nominal speed of the block and cruises for a period of
  time. A triangle occurs when the nominal speed is not reached within the block. Both of these 
  velocity profiles may also be truncated on either end with no acceleration or deceleration ramps, 
  as they can be influenced by the conditions of neighboring blocks, where the acceleration ramps
  are defined by constant acceleration equal to the maximum allowable acceleration of a block.
  
  Since the stepper algorithm already assumes to begin executing a planner block by accelerating
  from the planner entry speed and cruise if the nominal speed is reached, we only need to know 
  when to begin deceleration to the end of the block. Hence, only the distance from the end of the
  block to begin a deceleration ramp is computed for the stepper algorithm when requested.

TODO:
  When a feed hold or feedrate override is reduced, the velocity profile must execute a 
  deceleration over the existing plan. By logic, since the plan already decelerates to zero
  at the end of the buffer, any replanned deceleration mid-way will never exceed this. It
  will only asymptotically approach this in the worst case scenario.
  
  - For a feed hold, we simply need to plan and compute the stopping point within a block 
    when velocity decelerates to zero. We then can recompute the plan with the already 
    existing partial block planning code and set the system to a QUEUED state.
    - When a feed hold is initiated, the main program should be able to continue doing what
      it has been, i.e. arcs, parsing, but needs to be able to reinitialize the plan after
      it has come to a stop.
    
  - For a feed rate override (reduce-only), we need to enforce a deceleration until we 
    intersect the reduced nominal speed of a block after it's been planned with the new
    overrides and the newly planned block is accelerating or cruising only. If the new plan
    block is decelerating at the intersection point, we keep decelerating until we find a 
    valid intersection point. Once we find this point, we can then resume onto the new plan,
    but we may need to adjust the deceleration point in the intersection block since the 
    feedrate override could have intersected at an acceleration ramp. This would change the
    acceleration ramp to a cruising, so the deceleration point will have changed, but the 
    plan will have not. It should still be valid for the rest of the buffer. Coding this
    can get complicated, but it should be doable. One issue could be is in how to handle 
    scenarios when a user issues several feedrate overrides and inundates this code. Does 
    this method still work and is robust enough to compute all of this on the fly? This is
    the critical question. However, we could block user input until the planner has time to 
    catch to solve this as well. 
  
  - When the feed rate override increases, we don't have to do anything special. We just
    replan the entire buffer with the new nominal speeds and adjust the maximum junction
    speeds accordingly.
